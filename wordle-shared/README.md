# Wordle Shared

This is just a shared repository featuring interfaces and enums that are shared between client and server for easier development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone git@github.com:4thguy/wordle-project.git`

## Development

Friendly reminder that if you change something in this folder, you have to run the `pnpm install` process again in both wordle-client and wordle-server to sync the changes.

## Contributing
At the moment I am not accepting code contributions as the project is still under initial development, however if you think you have identified an issue or have a feature request please feel free to open an issue and I will look into it.
