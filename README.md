# Wordle Project
## Description

Welcome! This repository houses the development of a [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) game, with a primary focus on refining the client-side user interface. While some parts of the UI are more polished than others, ongoing work is being conducted on both the client-facing and server sides to enhance the overall user experience.

## Features
* You can actually guess the word if you limit yourself to ones that made it to the server so far
* Responsive design
* A theme with colors that respect your light/dark mode preferences

## Components

   * *wordle-client*: This component encompasses the client interface, developed using Vue.js.
   * *wordle-shared*: Here, you'll find shared functions and classes written in TypeScript, aiding in the seamless interaction between different project components.
   * *wordle-server*: This segment hosts the Node.js server, also written in TypeScript, responsible for handling server-side operations and interactions.

## Requirements

Developed on NodeJS v20 using pnpm to manage the npm packages and VueJS 3 for the client.
