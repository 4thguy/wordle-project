# Wordle Client

This is the wordle client, developed using VueJS 3. It is still under development with planned features, but right now the game is playable.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone git@github.com:4thguy/wordle-project.git`
2. Navigate to the wordle-client directory: `cd wordle-client`
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`

## Running
1. Navigate to the wordle-client directory: `cd wordle-client`
2. Run `pnpm dev`

This will compile the project and serve it locally. You can now access the Wordle Client in your browser at http://localhost:5173/ by default.

Any changes made to the project files will cause the client to reload with the new changes.

## Stack
This project uses VueJS for the actual app, using SASS to facilitate CSS development.

To further facilitate theming and animations, this project leverages some animations from animate.css and bootstrap for theming.

## Contributing
At the moment I am not accepting code contributions as the project is still under initial development, however if you think you have identified an issue or have a feature request please feel free to open an issue and I will look into it.
